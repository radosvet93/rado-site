> As a senior engineer, time management is not just about getting through your own to-do list. It's about balancing individual contributions, mentoring others, supporting your team, and still protecting space for the deep, high-leverage work that really moves the organisation forward.

Over the years, I've built a system that helps me focus on what matters, cut distractions, and make deliberate trade-offs about where my attention goes.

## The Time Management Matrix

I rely on a four-quadrant time management matrix that splits work into:

1. Urgent and Important (critical incidents, production issues, hard deadlines)
2. **Not Urgent but Important** (planning, mentoring, architecture reviews, long-term improvements)
3. Urgent but Not Important (ad-hoc requests, most emails, some meetings)
4. Not Urgent and Not Important (distractions, shallow work that doesn't really move things forward)

Most senior and lead engineers end up buried in Quadrant 1, jumping from incident to incident. I deliberately shift my time into Quadrant 2. That's where I can create long-term impact: mentoring teammates, improving processes, creating and reviewing architecture decisions, or tackling technical debt. It doesn't always feel urgent, but it's the work that prevents future fires and accelerates the whole team.

## The 80/20 Rule

Not every task deserves the same energy. I use the Pareto Principle as a filter: which 20% of work creates 80% of the value for the team or product? That usually means prioritising unblockers (things that enable others), high-impact refactors, or documenting decisions clearly so the whole team benefits.

The flip side is saying no. As a senior, you'll constantly be pulled into discussions, meetings, or requests that look urgent but don't matter in the long run. Protecting time for the few things that really matter requires politely declining or delegating the rest.

## Weekly Planning, Not Just Daily Planning

One shift that's made the biggest difference for me is planning at the weekly level rather than just the daily level. Senior work rarely fits neatly into one day, projects stretch across weeks, and mentoring requires consistent follow-up.

At the start of each week, I set three priorities that I want to move forward no matter what. These are always tied to Quadrant 2 work: things like pairing with a teammate to unblock them, pushing through a technical debt initiative, or thinking about architecture improvement. My daily plan then ladders up into those weekly priorities. That way, even if a day gets derailed by unexpected fires (quadrant 1), the week as a whole still makes progress on the most important work.

## Removing Distractions

I treat distractions as a tax on focus. Email is checked once per day, not every 15 minutes. My inbox is organised into folders so it's instantly obvious what matters. I block out "deep work" sessions in my calendar to write code or creating and reviewing architecture decisions, and I defend that time.

## Saying No With Purpose

Time management at the senior level is really about leverage. Every yes to something small is often a no to something with far greater impact. I've learned to say no to unimportant requests, but also to explain _why_. It's not just about protecting my time, it's about modelling for the team that focus is more valuable than busyness.

## Final Thoughts

Managing time as a senior engineer is about steering your attention to the highest-impact work. For me, that means prioritising Quadrant 2, applying the 80/20 rule, and cutting distractions before they cut me. It's not about squeezing more into the day. It's about ensuring the time you spend creates lasting value for your team, your codebase, and the business.
