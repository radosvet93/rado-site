> If you've ever tried to manage state, lifecycle, or side effects in a React application, you've likely touched **React Hooks**. They were introduced to simplify our code, making it more readable, reusable and testable. But while they solve a lot of problems, they also open the door to subtle bugs and patterns that don't scale well if misunderstood.

The difference between a junior and a senior developer's use of hooks isn't just knowing they exist; it's understanding when and how to apply them for long-term code health.

## What Are React Hooks?

In simple terms, **React Hooks** are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. Before hooks, you had to use class components to manage state and side effects, which often led to verbose code and made it difficult to share stateful logic between components.

Hooks brought a breath of fresh air, allowing us to build an entire application with just function components. The most common hooks you'll encounter are:

- `useState`: For managing local component state.
- `useEffect`: For handling side effects like API calls, subscriptions, or manual DOM manipulation.
- `useContext`: For providing state to a deeply nested component without prop drilling.
- `useRef`: For accessing DOM elements or holding a mutable value that doesn't trigger a re-render.

## Why React Hooks Matter in Real Projects

Hooks are not just a nice-to-have feature; they are the new mental model for writing clean, composable React applications. They encourage **composition over inheritance**, allowing you to build complex features by combining simple, single-purpose components and custom hooks.

By abstracting repetitive logic into reusable **custom hooks**, you can significantly reduce boilerplate. For example, a custom `useFetch` hook can be created once and then used across multiple components that need to fetch data, making the consuming component's code cleaner and more focused on its presentation logic.

## Commonly Used React Hooks

Let's dive into some of the most fundamental hooks and a common pitfall to watch out for.

### useState

This is your go-to hook for managing state within a component.

```jsx showLineNumbers
function DarkModeToggle() {
	const [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode] = useState(false);

	return (
		<button onClick={() => setIsDarkMode(!isDarkMode)}>
			{isDarkMode ? 'Light Mode' : 'Dark Mode'}
		</button>
	);
}
```

### useEffect

This is arguably the most powerful and often misunderstood hook. It's used for any "side effect" - something that happens outside of the component's rendering cycle.

A classic example is fetching data from an API:

```jsx showLineNumbers
function PostList() {
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/posts')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setPosts(data));
  }, []); // The empty dependency array means this runs only once on mount

  return (
    // ...render list of posts
  );
}
```

**The Pitfall: The dependency array.** Forgetting to include a dependency can lead to stale data. Conversely, including a primitive value that changes on every render (like an object or a function) can cause an infinite loop. Always remember to ask yourself, "What values from my component scope does this effect depend on?"

### useContext

Replaces prop drilling with context.

```jsx showLineNumbers
const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
return <div className={theme}>Hello</div>;
```

### useRef

Keeps a stable reference across renders. Useful for DOM elements or values you don't want to trigger re-renders.

```tsx showLineNumbers
const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);
```

## Advanced & Practical Hooks

For more complex apps, you'll often reach for these:

- `useReducer`: When your state logic becomes more complex than a simple boolean or string, `useReducer` can be a great alternative to multiple `useState` calls. It's ideal for managing state that has transitions between multiple states (like a complex form or a state machine).
- `useMemo` & `useCallback`: These hooks are for **performance optimisation**. They memoise values and functions, respectively, to prevent unnecessary re-renders. A common anti-pattern is using them everywhere; they can actually hurt performance if not used wisely. Use them only when you have a noticeable performance issue that needs fixing.
- **Custom hooks**: abstract repetitive logic, e.g. data fetching, debouncing, or feature toggles.

## Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns

From my experience, here are some common mistakes I see developers make with hooks:

- **Overusing `useEffect`:** It's common to see `useEffect` used to "sync" two pieces of state. Instead, try to **derive state** from existing state whenever possible. If `B` depends on `A`, calculate `B` from `A` directly rather than using a `useEffect`.
- **Premature Custom Hooks:** Just like my previous post on [premature abstraction](./when-dry-goes-wrong), don't create a custom hook for a pattern you've only seen once. Wait for the pattern to prove itself. A custom hook that's too generic can be just as brittle as a multi-prop component.
- **Forgetting Cleanup Functions:** For effects that involve subscriptions, event listeners, or timers, always return a cleanup function from your `useEffect`. This prevents memory leaks and subtle bugs.

## Best Practices for Using React Hooks

- **Start Simple:** Don't try to solve every problem with a custom hook. Let the component's needs dictate the abstraction.
- **Co-locate:** Keep hooks close to the code they relate to. If a `useState` and `useEffect` are only used for one component, keep them in that component. Don't move them into a generic file "just in case."
- **Use TypeScript:** It's a lifesaver for custom hooks. Strong typing on your hook's inputs and outputs ensures they are used correctly and helps your editor provide better auto-completion.
- **Test Custom Hooks:** A well-tested custom hook is a joy to work with. Use a testing library to ensure your hooks behave as expected.

## Real-World Example: A Custom Hook Done Right

A perfect example of a custom hook is one that debounces a value, like user input in a search bar. This prevents us from making an API call on every keystroke.

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export function useDebounce<T>(value: T, delay: number): T {
	const [debounced, setDebounced] = useState(value);

	useEffect(() => {
		const handler = setTimeout(() => setDebounced(value), delay);
		return () => clearTimeout(handler);
	}, [value, delay]);

	return debounced;
}
```

This hook is simple, has a single purpose, and can be easily tested. Now, our search component is much cleaner:

```tsx showLineNumbers
const SearchInput = () => {
	const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
	const debouncedSearchTerm = useDebounce(searchTerm, 500);

	// Now you can safely make an API call with `debouncedSearchTerm`
	useEffect(() => {
		if (debouncedSearchTerm) {
			// make API call here
		}
	}, [debouncedSearchTerm]);

	return (
		<input type="text" placeholder="Search..." onChange={(e) => setSearchTerm(e.target.value)} />
	);
};
```

## Recap / TL;DR

- React hooks simplify state and side-effect management.
- Master the basics (`useState`, `useEffect`) before jumping into advanced hooks.
- Repetition is better than premature abstraction.
- Custom hooks should be small, focused, and well-named.
- Always clean up effects and test custom hooks in isolation.

## Final Thoughts

Hooks are more than a React feature, they're the core mental model of modern React development. When used well, they lead to clean, composable code and better team collaboration. But when overused or abstracted too early, they create headaches.

The key is balance: let patterns emerge naturally, focus on readability, and resist the temptation to be "too clever." That's how you make hooks work for you, not against you.
